Prodigy InfoTech Internship Task 2: Password Strength Checker
Task Description:
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I was tasked with developing a program to evaluate the strength of user-entered passwords. 
This task involves assessing the password based on predefined conditions and categorizing it as strong, medium, or weak.

Program Functionality:
The Python program I developed performs the following functions:

User Input:
The program prompts the user to enter a password.

Password Strength Evaluation:
The program evaluates the password based on specific conditions to determine its strength.
It categorizes the password as strong, medium, or weak.

Criteria for Password Strength:

Strong Password:
Length of 8 characters or more
Contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one special character

Medium Password:
Length of 3-8 characters
Contains at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit

Weak Password:
Any password not meeting the criteria for strong or medium passwords.

This program provides a clear and straightforward way to assess the strength of passwords, helping users create more secure passwords based on common security guidelines.
